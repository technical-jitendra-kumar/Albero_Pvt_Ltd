                            disputes for services including software development, SaaS products,

                        <p>
                            Advance payments are required before project initiation. Once work has begun,
                            advance payments are generally non-refundable as resources and development
                            time are already allocated to the project.

                            Payments associated with completed project milestones are non-refundable.
                            Each milestone represents completed work and deliverables approved by the client.

                            up to the cancellation date will be billed accordingly. Any pending

                        <p>
                            Marketing services involve planning, strategy development, and campaign
                            execution. Once a campaign has begun or advertising spend has been allocated,
                            refunds cannot be processed.
